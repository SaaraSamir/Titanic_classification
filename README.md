# Titanic_classification
First, I did some analysis on the dataset so that there are no null values left, I have dropped some columns that I found not necessary in the classification 
Second I divided the data to train and validation data 
Third I did the classification using 4 models which are support vector machine, GaussianNB, RandomForest, and one layer of neural network
the RandomForest did the best performance and had the highest accuracy which was 84%
Then I predict the labels(survived and not survived) for the test dataset as it has no labels using the RandomForest
this notebook was for learning purposes and I hope this can help you
